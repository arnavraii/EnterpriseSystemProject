<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

## Fish Species Prediction
*Predict which species the fish belongs to*

The image data of Natural Scenes around the world.Want to build powerful Neural network that can classify these images with more accuracy.
This database is available on : https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification

Files/directories used in the code:

categories :- jason file containig the 6 different classes ('buildings','forest','glacier','mountain','sea', 'street').

seg_train and seg_pred which are contained in a folder called classification which holds training and validation images.

seg_pred :- containing the images to be predicted.

I ran the Transfer Learning Keras model and updated the pre-trained weights by training it on the train images dataset. Acheived an overall accuracy of 90.7% on the validation dataset (seg_test).

I have uploaded both an offline notebook as well as my google-colab notebook.
